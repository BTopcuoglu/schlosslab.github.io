We meet for our weekly lab meetings on Wednesdays at 12:30 PM in 1530 MSRB I. We
generally meet for an hour. After 15 min of set up and announcements we have a
presentation for the remainder of the hour that is led by one individual.
Each week we rotate around the lab and will cover four different formats:

* **Research talk:** An update of your current research progress in the lab.
This should involved slides. Please send slides to research group by 8 AM on
Monday morning so people can have a chance to review what you will be talking
about.
* **Journal club:** Discussion of a paper that you find worth reading. To cut
down on the problem of crappy papers, read the paper before you pick it out.
Send paper to group by 8 AM on Monday morning.
* **Chalk talk:** No slides. Present an idea for a future research project.
This should include an observation, hypothesis, predictions, and discussion of
several specific aims.
* **Code review:** Select a chunk of code (~50 lines) that you either want to
share with the lab, want help with, or that you have recently written. This may
also involve some type of demo of a package you have recently discovered and
want to share.

\* Pat will be out these days. When there are journal clubs on these dates, the
lab will still be expected to meet and discuss the papers.

***Note:***
If you need to switch dates with someone, you need to switch the format with
them as well. This will insure that everyone will do one of the four formats.
