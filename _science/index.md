__Colorectal cancer:__
There are 1.4 million people in the US with a history of colorectal cancer (CRC) [1]. Although the mortality rate has declined in recent decades, incidence rates are expected to rise due to the aging population and increasing occurrence of CRC in younger individuals [2-3]. Cancerous or precancerous cells in the colon form lesions which are typically detected via colonoscopy, but the technique is invasive, expensive, and only 39% of patients return for subsequent screening. There is a need for improved non-invasive screening methods [4]. We are using an innovative source to detect CRC: the human microbiome. Human microbiome can directly contribute to the development of CRC [5] . We try to identify microbial biomarkers associated with CRC and to develop computational models that improve the non-invasive detection of CRC [6-7].
