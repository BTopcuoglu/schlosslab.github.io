I am in the process of completing my studies as a Microbiology major with a minor in Global Public Health and Epidemiology at Michigan State University. Currently, I work with Sarah Tomkovich to explore how stresses on the gut microbiome affect colonization of *Clostridium difficile*. During the school year, I am part of the ShadeLab at MSU where I study the heritability of microbial communities using seeds.
