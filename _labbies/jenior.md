For my thesis research I study the role that the gut microbiota has in resisting antibiotic-associated colonization of 
the bacterial pathogen Clostridium difficile. Using a mouse model of infection with varying antibiotic pretreatments, 
I quantify changes in remaining gut community structure and metabolism through a combination of methods; including 
culture-based techniques, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenome-directed metatranscriptomics, and genome-scaling metabolic 
modeling. Preliminary results have revealed several groups of bacteria and metabolic pathways that may be involved in 
outcompeting C. difficile for it's preferred nutrient niche during infection. Additionally, C. difficile alters it's own 
metabolism to cope with unique environments in which it is colonizing. These data may prove valuable for identifying 
probiotic species or processes that can prevent C. difficile colonization in susceptible individuals in a targeted way.
