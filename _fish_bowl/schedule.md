We meet for our weekly lab meetings on Wednesdays at 3:30 PM in 1530 MSRB I. We
generally meet for an hour. After 15 min of set up and announcements we have a
presentation for the remainder of the hour that is led by one individual.
Each week we rotate around the lab and will cover four different formats:

* **Research talk:** An update of your current research progress in the lab.
This should involved slides. Please send slides to research group by 8 AM on
Monday morning so people can have a chance to review what you will be talking
about.
* **Journal club:** Discussion of a paper that you find worth reading. To cut
down on the problem of crappy papers, read the paper before you pick it out.
Send paper to group by the end of the Friday before journal club.
* **Chalk talk:** No slides. Present an idea for a future research project.
This should include an observation, hypothesis, predictions, and discussion of
several specific aims.
* **Code review:** Select a chunk of code (~50 lines) that you either want to
share with the lab, want help with, or that you have recently written. This may
also involve some type of demo of a package you have recently discovered and
want to share.
