### Safety

I care deeply about the physical and mental health of the people that work in and around my lab. Beyond your own safety, failure to follow proper laboratory practices could put the safety of other lab members and the viability of the lab as an entity into jeopardy. With this in mind...

* Familiarize yourself with the lab's chemical hygiene plan
* Follow the plan
* If you need personal protective equipment (PPE), order it - no questions asked
* If your health status changes (including pregnancy), tell me in private so that we can investigate how this might affect your ability to work in the lab.
* If you see someone acting in an unsafe manner, simply remind them that they need to do X
* If you are about to take a course of antibiotics, you should remove yourself from the laboratory until a week after finishing the course of antibiotics. There is a real risk that you could develop a *Clostridium difficile* Infection if you do not.


### Career development is a continuous process

You should have a list of things you would like to learn and apply to your research or keep in your back pocket. These can be as simple as improving time management to learning d3js. You will never develop these skills unless you work on them. Plan ahead at the scale of daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly for when and how you will develop these skills



### General expectations for labbies

***Prime directive:*** Make the research group look good by your research, behavior, commitment, and citizenship.

* Effort
  * Hard to be successful treating this as a 40-hour week job
  * Being present 40 hours isn't the same as working 40 hours
  * If you are not passionate about what you are doing, we need to talk.
  * Be your own worst critic
  * Seek to improve yourself without feeling the need to compete against your colleagues

* Research
  * Present at a national meeting each year (see below)
  * Apply for any and all funding that is available for research and travel
  * Give me a weekly update on last week's effort, plans for the next week, and progress towards achieving long term goals

* Reading
  * 3+ papers per week
  * Read broadly and within your special area
  * Sign up for e-TOC alerts; review search terms regularly

* Writing
  * 1000+ new words per week
  * Doesn't matter what the topic is, just write.

* Citizenship
  * Share your "life hacks" with other members of the lab
  * Give information about career development opportunities as you learn of them
  * Provide support to colleagues in the lab by reading drafts, engaging in discussions, and being a positive influence
  * Acknowledge and build off the work of others in the lab

* Lab meetings
  * Research / chalk talk / journal club format
  * Research slides should be sent out the Monday before the lab meeting
  * Papers for journal club should be sent out the Friday before lab meeting
  * All people are expected to read the slides and paper before lab meeting. If you don't, don't bother coming.
  * Only one person speaks at a time

* Seminars
  * Plan presentation date to work with my schedule
  * Give me complete slides 10 days in advance of talk
  * Practice talk with me and lab
  * Practice talk with your colleagues

* Vacation
  * 10 days per year plus time between 12/23 and 1/2
  * Let me know in advance
  * Don't tell me, ask me.

* Personal well-being
  * I cannot read minds and bodies
  * If you are sick physically or mentally, I need to know
  * We can work out leaves of absence, reduced hours, altered expectations, etc.


### Specific expectations for each rank of labbie

#### Graduate students
* Obtain at least a B in each of your courses
* Pass preliminary exam on your first try
* Develop the concepts for your checkpoint proposal with me, but write it independently of me
* At least two accepted before you defend (but you will be able to get more than three)
* As a senior graduate student, look for opportunities to mentor undergraduates
* Fight for your project - don't let me break it up to give to someone else
* By the time you defend, you should be the smartest person in the room on your topic
* You have my priority
* Communicate your career goals to me as they develop

#### Postdocs
* Finish papers from you PhD in a timely manner, preferably outside of normal business hours.
* Talk with me about pursuing funding opportunities
* Work with me to find a project
* Own and drive your project
* Look to me more for suggests than direction
* At least a paper a year
* Look for opportunities to mentor undergraduates
* Contracts are to be renewed each year depending on progress towards these goals
* My goal will be to give you three months notice if funding is short or I think it is time for you to move on
* When you start, you should have a good sense of where your career is going, communicate those to me so that I can help you to work towards them

#### Staff
* You report directly to me. If anyone asks you to do anything, tell them you need to talk to me first
* You will have a research project that you will work on with my direction
* Communicate your long term career goals to me so that I can help you
* You will likely be asked to entertain far more of my crazy ideas than anyone else in the lab
* Although you have finished (or paused) your formal training, I still expect you to continue to develop skills while you work in the lab


### Expectations of me

I promise to...

* Give a damn  
* Fight like hell to keep funding
* Consult the lab when new people will potentially join us
* Review drafts within 24-48 hours of receiving them
* Make room on my schedule to meet with you within 3 days of request; will make room for a weekly meeting if needed. This presumes that you are current on sending me weekly progress reports
* Give information about career development and funding opportunities as I learn of them
* Be your biggest advocate
* Nominate you for awards as appropriate
* Support you to attend one conference per year assuming you have a poster to present
* Direct you along a project that is capable of generating 3 papers that belong together in a thesis (graduate students), 1 paper a year (postdocs), and liberally offer authorship to research staff.
* Include you in ancillary papers as your availability permits
* Invite you to work on side projects - it is up to you to say yes or no. But once you say "yes", you cannot quit.
* Be enthusiastic about all everyone's project
* Protect confidences and will not discuss you with any other students. I may seek mentoring advice from people I respect and will always do so with your best interest in mind.
* Do my best to maintain a team of scientists that is demographically and scientifically diverse
