### Boot camp
Very few people join the lab with this foundation (Pat didn't!), but over time, we've found that these tools are pretty critical to success in the lab. Don't feel like you need to master this stack in your first week of being in the lab. By going through these tutorials and actually using the tools in your daily work you'll eventually get it.

* bash
  * [Software Carpentry Workshop tutorial](#) (required)
  * [Codecademy materials](#) (optional)
* R
  * [Software Carpentry Workshop tutorial](#) (required)
  * [Pat's MICRBIOL612](#) notes
* knitr
  * [RStudio materials](#) (required)
  * [Pat's MICRBIOL612 notes](#)
* git
  * [Software Carpentry Workshop tutorial](#) (required)
  * [Codecademy materials](#) (optional)
  * Fork [lab website source code](https://www.github.com/SchlossLab/schlosslab.github.io) and submit a pull request to add a file with your information and a picture
* mothur
  * Run the [MiSeq SOP](http://www.mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP) and read the [Kozich et al. (2013) paper](/assetts/pdfs/2013_kozich.pdf).
* Become familiar with Axiom
  * `ssh axiom.ccmb.med.umich.edu`
  * `cd /mnt/EXT/Schloss-data/`
  * `mkdir [your uniqname]`
* [Read the papers](/papers) where Pat is first or last author from last 2 yrs and then dig into the rest of the literature


### Useful software
We are primarily a Mac OS X lab and we make use of a Linux-based computer cluster. Thankfully the tool set that we use can be ported to any operating system.

* [gitbash]() (for Windows users)
* [PuTTY]() (for Windows users)
* [mothur]()
* [R]() and [RStudio]() (you need both)
* Text editor (personal preference): [Atom](), [Sublime Text](), [TextWrangler](), [vim](), [emacs]()
* Paper management software (personal preference, but we're done with EndNote): [Papers](), [Zotero]()
