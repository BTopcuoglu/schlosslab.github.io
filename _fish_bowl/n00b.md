title: Help I'm New to the Lab
---

Here's a checklist and resources of things for people that are new (or not so new) to the lab. Before freaking out, be sure to read this [blog post](http://blog.mothur.org/2016/01/04/Suck-until-you-dont/) from Pat.

### Logistics
The first week in the lab can be a bit hectic, welcome! Here are a number of items that we have found are critical to getting off on a good foot...

* Desk, bench space, restroom, tour
  * Talk to Pat
* Benefits enrollment
  * Talk to Margaret Allen in M&I main office
* Keys
  * Talk to Judy Opp in Microbiome Sequencing Core
* Email address
  * Talk to Margaret Allen in M&I main office
* [Lab meeting schedule](/fish_bowl/schedule.html)
  * Lab meetings are Thursdays at 9:00 AM in 1530 MSRB I
* Familiarize yourself with the [lab expectations and policies](/fish_bowl/expectations.html)
* Axiom account
  * Email <a href="mailto:axiom-help@umich.edu">Axiom Help</a> and tell them to add your uniqname to the Schloss Lab account
* Get on to Schloss Lab mailing list
  * Go to the [Schloss Lab MCommunity Page](https://mcommunity.umich.edu/#group:schlosslab) and add your email to the mailing list.
* Create a [GitHub](http://www.github.com) account and join the [Schloss Lab group](http://www.github.com/SchlossLab)
* [MICRBIOL812 schedule](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/microbiology-immunology/students/seminars.htm)
* [Departmental seminar schedule](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/microbiology-immunology/tags/Seminars)
* Reimbursements
  * Talk with Sheryl Smith in the main office and see Pat for a ShortCode


### Boot camp
Very few people join the lab with the foundation to do reproducible microbial ecology analysis (Pat didn't!), but over time, we've found that these tools are pretty critical to success in the lab. Don't feel like you need to master this stack in your first week of being in the lab. By going through these tutorials and actually using the tools in your daily work you'll eventually get it. This is basically our "Full Stack".

  * Run the [MiSeq SOP](http://www.mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP) and read the [Kozich et al. (2013) paper](/assetts/pdfs/2013_kozich.pdf).
* Become familiar with Axiom
  * `ssh axiom.ccmb.med.umich.edu`

  * `mkdir [your uniqname]`
* [Read the papers](/papers) where Pat is first or last author from last 2 yrs and then dig into the rest of the literature


### Useful software
We are primarily a Mac OS X lab and we make use of a Linux-based computer cluster. Thankfully the tool set that we use can be ported to any operating system.

* [git bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io) (for Windows users)
* [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org) (for Windows users)
* [mothur](https://github.com/mothur/mothur/releases)
* [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) (you need both)
* Text editor (personal preference): [Atom](https://atom.io), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com), [TextWrangler](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textwrangler/id404010395?mt=12), [vim](http://www.vim.org), [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
* Paper management software (we're done with EndNote, otherwise this is a personal preferece): [Papers](http://www.papersapp.com), [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org)
