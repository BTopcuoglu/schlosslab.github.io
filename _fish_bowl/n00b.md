title: Help I'm New to the Lab
---

Here's a checklist and resources of things for people that are new (or not so new) to the lab. Before freaking out, be sure to read this [blog post](http://blog.mothur.org/2016/01/04/Suck-until-you-dont/) from Pat.

### Logistics
The first week in the lab can be a bit hectic, welcome! Here are a number of items that we have found are critical to getting off on a good foot...

* Desk, bench space, restroom, tour
  * Talk to Pat
* Benefits enrollment
  * Talk to Margaret Allen in M&I main office
* Keys
  * Talk to Lisa who sits at the center desk outside of Pat's office in 1520 MSRB II
* Email address
  * Talk to Margaret Allen in M&I main office
* [Lab meeting schedule](/fish_bowl/schedule.html)
  * Lab meetings are Thursdays at 9:00 AM in 1530 MSRB I
* Familiarize yourself with the [lab expectations and policies](/fish_bowl/expectations.html)
* Flux account
  * Email <a href="mailto:hpc-support@umich.edu">Flux Help</a> and tell them to add your uniqname to the "Schloss Lab allocation"
  * Complete and submit the [flux account form](http://arc-ts.umich.edu/fluxform)
* Get on to Schloss Lab mailing list
  * Go to the [Schloss Lab MCommunity Page](https://mcommunity.umich.edu/#group:schlosslab) and add your email to the mailing list.
* Create a [GitHub](http://www.github.com) account and join the [Schloss Lab group](http://www.github.com/SchlossLab)
* [MICRBIOL812 schedule](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/microbiology-immunology/students/seminars.htm)
* [Departmental seminar schedule](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/microbiology-immunology/tags/Seminars)
* Reimbursements
  * Talk with Sheryl Smith in the main office and see Pat for a ShortCode


### Boot camp
Very few people join the lab with the foundation to do reproducible microbial ecology analysis (Pat didn't!), but over time, we've found a set of tools are pretty critical to success in the lab. We think of this as our [full stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack) for doing the analytical end as a microbial ecologist who is concerned about the reproducibility of their analysis. Don't feel like you need to master this stack in your first week of being in the lab. By going through these tutorials and actually using the tools in your daily work you'll eventually get it. The Schloss Lab Full Stack includes: mothur, R, knitr, git, bash, and make. In your first week or two of being in the lab, you should do the following tutorials and do them all on Flux, the high performance computer cluster that the lab uses:

* Become familiar with Flux
  * `ssh flux.arc-ts.umich.edu`
  * `cd /nfs/turbo/schloss-lab`
  * `mkdir [your uniqname]`
* bash: [Software Carpentry bash tutorial](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
* mothur: [MiSeq SOP](http://www.mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP) and the [Kozich et al. (2013) paper](/assetts/pdfs/2013_kozich.pdf)
* R: [minimalR](http://www.riffomonas.org/minimalR)
* git, knitr, bash, make: [Reproducible research tutorial](http://www.riffomonas.org/reproducible_research)
* Fork [lab website source code](https://www.github.com/SchlossLab/schlosslab.github.io) and submit a pull request to add a file with your information and a picture
* [Read the papers](/papers) where Pat is first or last author from last 2 yrs and then dig into the rest of the literature


You can supplement those materials with these tutorials and cheat sheets:

* bash
  * [Codecademy materials](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)
* R and knitr
	* [R Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)
  * [Rmarkdown materials](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)
  * [Software Carpentry Workshop tutorial 1](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/)
  * [Software Carpentry Workshop tutorial 2](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/)
* git
  * [Software Carpentry Workshop tutorial](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
  * [Codecademy materials](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git)
* make
  * [Software Carpentry Workshop tutorial](http://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/)


### Useful software
We are primarily a Mac OS X lab and we make use of a Linux-based computer cluster. Thankfully the tool set that we use can be ported to any operating system.

* For Windows users one of
  * [git bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io) and [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org)
  * [enable Bash on Windows 10](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36352627/how-to-enable-bash-in-windows-10-developer-preview)
* [mothur](https://github.com/mothur/mothur/releases)
* [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) (you need both)
* Text editor (personal preference): [Atom](https://atom.io), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com), [TextWrangler](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textwrangler/id404010395?mt=12), [vim](http://www.vim.org), [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
* Paper management software (we're done with EndNote, otherwise this is a personal preference): [Papers](http://www.papersapp.com), [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org)
