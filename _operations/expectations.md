## Expectations of me

I promise to...
* give a damn
* fight like hell to keep funding
* consult the lab when new people will potentially join us
* review drafts within 24-48 hours of receiving them
* make room on schedule to meet with you within 3 days of request; will make room for a weekly meeting if needed
* give information about career development opportunities as I learn of them
* be your biggest advocate
* nominate you for awards as appropriate
* support you to attend one conference per year assuming you have a poster to present.
* direct you along a project that is capable of generating 3 papers that belong together in a thesis
* include you in ancillary papers as your availability permits
* invite you to work on side projects - it is up to you to say yes or no. but once you say "yes", you cannot quit.
* be enthusiastic about all everyone's project
* protect confidences and will not discuss you with any other students. I may seek mentoring advice from people I respect and will always do so with your best interest in mind.
