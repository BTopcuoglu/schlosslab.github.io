We are no longer looking for candidates for this position.


The laboratory of Patrick D. Schloss at the University of Michigan is recruiting individuals interested in postdoctoral training in the field of microbiome research. Our research group has openings for postdoctoral trainees interested in understanding how gut microbiota affect the progression of diseases including *Clostridium difficile* infections and the severity of colorectal cancer. We primarily use culture-independent tools combined with computational methods to answer biological questions in a community context.

*MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS:* The successful candidate will have a doctoral degree or equivalent in a related field. They should also have excellent scientific writing ability as demonstrated by at least one publication, strong oral communication skills, the ability to work effectively and with colleagues, and evidence of being an independent self-starter with strong time-management skills.

*PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS:* Candidates with prior experience using mothur and R are sought after. Although not critical, prior experience with git, GitHub, RMarkdown, and make would be preferred.

We place a strong emphasis on mentoring trainees towards their career development goals using [Individualized Development Plans](http://myidp.sciencecareers.org). To help facilitate this process there are numerous training opportunities in the area of basic and translational microbiology within the Department of Microbiology & Immunology at the University of Michigan School of Medicine, including a weekly microbiome seminar series, several postdoctoral training grants, and professional development bootcamps. Additionally, there are opportunities for collaborations within the School of Medicine and a growing number of microbial ecology researchers from across campus. Previous trainees from the Schloss lab have gone on to research positions in academia, government, and industry.
