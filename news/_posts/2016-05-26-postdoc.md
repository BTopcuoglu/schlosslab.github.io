Interested in education and web development? We're looking to hire someone interested in a different kind of postdoc experience at @umich. The project would involve developing interactive web-based tutorials to improve the reproducibility of microbial ecology data analysis. The Schloss lab is committed to building a diverse laboratory and we strongly encourage applications from female and minority candidates. If you are interested in the position, please email your CV and a cover letter describing your background and qualifications, and availability to Pat.
