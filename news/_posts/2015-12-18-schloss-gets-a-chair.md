Congratulations to the boss for being recognized by the Board of Regents this week with the Frederick G. Novy Collegiate Chair of Microbiome Research. We think this may be the first endowed chair specifically tied to microbiome research. We are all very excited that this honor recognizes the hard work of the lab in helping to direct the course of microbiome research. Dr. Novy was the founder of our department and so it is also a great tribute to the 100 year anniversary of the department's founding.
